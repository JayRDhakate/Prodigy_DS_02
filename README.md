Title: Titanic Dataset Analysis: Data Cleaning and Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

Description:

In this task, I conducted a comprehensive analysis of the Titanic dataset, encompassing three distinct datasets: train, test, and gender submission. The objective was to gain valuable insights into the dataset through rigorous data cleaning and exploratory data analysis (EDA) techniques.

Tasks accomplished:

1. **Data Cleaning**:
   - Handled missing values through imputation techniques.
   - Detected and addressed outliers to ensure data integrity.
   - Standardized data formats for consistency.

2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**:
   - Conducted a thorough examination of variable distributions.
   - Visualized relationships between variables to uncover potential correlations and dependencies.
   - Explored patterns and trends in the data using various statistical and visualization tools.
   - Utilized descriptive statistics to summarize key characteristics of the dataset.

3. **Visualization of Relationships**:
   - Employed a variety of visualization techniques (scatter plots, heatmaps, etc.) to illustrate the relationships between variables.
   - Identified significant factors influencing the target variable.

4. **Correlation Analysis**:
   - Calculated and visualized correlation matrices to understand the strength and direction of relationships between variables.
   - Extracted meaningful insights to inform subsequent modeling steps.

5. **Survival Rate Analysis**:
   - Investigated and visualized survival rates based on different attributes (e.g., class, age, gender, etc.).
   - Extracted key factors contributing to survival.

6. **Plots Based on Different Factors**:
   - Created a diverse set of plots, each highlighting different aspects of the dataset (e.g., age distribution, fare distribution, etc.).
   - Analyzed these plots to uncover additional insights.

This analysis provides a solid foundation for subsequent modeling and predictive tasks related to the Titanic dataset. The insights gained from this task are invaluable in understanding the underlying patterns within the data, which can be leveraged for further analysis or machine learning applications.
